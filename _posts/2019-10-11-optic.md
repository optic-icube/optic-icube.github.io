**OPTIC** is a BGP scheme allowing for an **immediate and optimal** (re)routing 
of BGP traffic after any internal event, for a low maintenance overhead, making 
internal events hitless for BGP transit traffic.

Thanks to OPTIC, internal events are hitless for the BGP traffic, which 
benefitss immediately from the new optimal BGP route.

 OPTIC can handle any single
internal event, be it a node (including the gateway itself) or link failure  or
a weight change. In addition, the overhead induced by the underlying update routines 
to anticipate the next event is low.  Most of the time, these latter do not even 
need to be called as our sets remain stable after most event in a well-designed and resilient enough network.
